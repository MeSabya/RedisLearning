# Redis Sentinel â€” High Availability

## How Redis offers High Availability and Automatic Failover ?

**Redis Sentinel**
Redis sentinel is the high availability solution offered by Redis. In case of a failure in your Redis cluster, Sentinel will automatically detects the point of failure and bring the cluster back to stable mode without any human intervention.

### What really happens inside Redis Sentinel ?

>Sentinel always checks the MASTER and SLAVE instances in the Redis cluster, checking whether they working as expected. If sentinel detects a failure in the MASTER node in a given cluster, Sentinel will start a failover process. As a result, Sentinel will pick a SLAVE instance and promote it to MASTER. Ultimately, the other remaining SLAVE instances will be automatically reconfigured to use the new MASTER instance.

ðŸ‘‰ *Furthermore, Sentinel is a robust distributed system, where multiple sentinels need to agree to about the fact a given master is no longer available. Then only the failover process starts a select a new MASTER node. This sentinel agreement is done according to the quorum value.*
