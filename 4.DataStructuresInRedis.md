# What are the underlying data structures used for Redis?

âœ” Strings are implemented using a C dynamic string library so that we don't pay (asymptotically speaking) for allocations in append operations. This way we have O(N) appends, for instance, instead of having quadratic behavior.

âœ” Lists are implemented with linked lists.

âœ” Sets and Hashes are implemented with hash tables.

âœ” Sorted sets are implemented with skip lists (a peculiar type of balanced trees).

### Strings
A Redis string is a good idea in all the obvious scenarios where you want to store an HTML page, but also when you want to avoid converting your already encoded data. 

### Lists 
- Use lists when you need to maintain values in the order they were inserted. Redis lists are often used as producer/consumer queues.
- The max length of a list is 2Â³Â² â€” 1 elements (4294967295, more than 4 billion of elements per list).

```Lua
LPUSH â€” Inserts a new element on the head
RPUSH â€” Inserts a new element on the tail
LPOP â€” Removes an element from the head
RPOP â€” Removes an element from tail
LRANGE â€” Prints an element from the specified position
```

***Explain Blocking operations on lists.***
ðŸ‘‰ This is a case when you want to do remove operations like RPOP/LPOP, but the list is already empty. In this case, remove operation will return null does nothing. In this case a consumer is forced to wait some time and retry again with RPOP.
So Redis implements commands called BRPOP and BLPOP which are versions of RPOP and LPOP able to block if the list is empty: This will return to the caller only when a new element is added to the list, or when a user-specified timeout is reached.

### Sets
A Redis set contains unique unordered Redis strings where each string only exists once per set.
You can take the union, intersection, and difference of multiple sets at once.

Sets have constant time access for membership checks (unlike lists), and 
Redis even has convenient random member removal and returning ("pop a random element from the set") or random member returning without replacement ("give me 30 random-ish unique users") or with replacement ("give me 7 cards, but after each selection, put the card back so it can potentially be sampled again").

```Lua
SADD â€” Adds a new element to the SET
SMEMBERS â€” To retrieve values from the KEY
SISMEMBER â€” To verify whether specified element is present in the SET
SPOP â€” To pop the element out from the SET
```

### Maps

```Lua
HMSET â€” Sets the specified fields to their respective values in the hash stored at key.
Time complexity: O(N) where N is the number of fields being set.
HGET â€” Returns the value associated with field in the hash stored at key.
Time complexity: O(1)
HGETALL â€” Returns all fields and values of the hash stored at key.
Time complexity: O(N) where N is the size of the hash.
```

### Sorted Set

>Sorted Set is a Set data structure that doesnâ€™t allow duplicate members. At the same time, its members are ordered in ascending order. By combining both, we can define a Sorted Set as an ordered collection of unique members.

*Sorted Set is similar to the Set data structure in Redis. Members can be a list of non-repeating strings. The only difference is that each member is associated with a score, a floating-point number that provides a sorting order for the Sorted Set. Members are always sorted from the smallest to the greatest score.*

- Accessing the middle of a sorted set is also very fast, so you can use Sorted Sets as a smart list of non-repeating elements where you can quickly access everything you need.

- That makes Sorted Sets an excellent choice of implementing real-time, low-latency leaderboards, priority queues, and secondary indexes.
- We can perform operations on Sorted Sets to add, remove, increment, and retrieve members. Usually, these operations start with the letter â€˜Z.â€™

**Example**:

###### Add new players and their steps to the game
Syntax: ZADD <key> <score> <member>
        
        ZADD players 790 Lester
        
        ZADD players 980 Mary 850 Alice

###### Increment/decrement player steps
Syntax: 
        ZINCRBY <key> <increment> <member>
        
        ZINCRBY players 10 Tom

###### Retrieve top 10 players by score
Defination: ZREVRANGE returns members in reversed-rank order, with scores ordered from high to low. 
            The ZRANGE command does the opposite to this. It returns members in rank order, with scores ordered from low to high.
  
Syntax: 
        ZREVRANGE <key> <start> <stop> [WITHSCORES]
        
        ZREVRANGE players 0 9 WITHSCORES

        1) "Mary"

        2) "980"

        3) "Alice"

        4) "850"

        5) "Lester"

        6) "790"

        7) "Frank"

        8) "740"
 
###### Retrieve the rank and the score of an individual player
Defination: ZRANK and ZREVRANK commands return the rank of a member, which is a 0 based index position.
Syntax:     [ZRANK|ZREVRANK] <key> <member>

The following command returns 0 for Dave, whoâ€™s currently at the bottom of the leaderboard.
127.0.0.1:6379> ZRANK players Dave
(integer) 0
  
###### Get the player count based on the score
For example, how many players had walked more than 500 but less than 700 steps?
The command ZCOUNT will count the members between the min and the max score. That is inclusive. The format of the command is:

Syntax: ZCOUNT <key> <min> <max>
ZCOUNT players 500 700
(integer) 4
  
###### Remove players from the game
Syntax: ZREM <key> <member> [<member> â€¦]
      ZREM players Barbara
