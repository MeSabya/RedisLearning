# Transactions in Redis Cluster
## What are Redis Transactions?
A handful of commands– **WATCH, EXEC, DISCARD and MULTI** — form the building blocks of Redis transactions. 
These building blocks allow a set of commands to be executed in just one step, and 
they come with two key guarantees:

👉*First, they ensure that the commands in the transaction will be executed in a sequential manner and are serialized. 
This means that a request from a different client won’t be served while a Redis transaction is being executed.*

👉*In addition, a Redis transaction is guaranteed to be “atomic”, which means that either all of the commands in it are executed, or none of them are executed.*

## REDIS Transaction Usage
A Redis transaction is entered using the **MULTI command**. 
The command always replies with OK. At this point the user can issue multiple commands. Instead of executing these commands, Redis will queue them. 
All the commands are executed once **EXEC** is called.

Calling DISCARD instead will flush the transaction queue and will exit the transaction.

The following example increments keys foo and bar atomically.

```redis
> MULTI
OK
> INCR foo
QUEUED
> INCR bar
QUEUED
> EXEC
1) (integer) 1
2) (integer) 1
```

>When a Redis connection is in the context of a MULTI request, all commands will reply with the string QUEUED (sent as a Status Reply from the point of view of the Redis protocol). A queued command is simply scheduled for execution when EXEC is called.

## What is the Redis WATCH Command?
>The WATCH command works by making the EXEC command conditional; in other words, 
>Redis will only perform a transaction if the WATCHed keys were not modified. If a WATCHed key was indeed modified, the transaction won’t be entered at all.

- The WATCH command can be called numerous times, and one WATCH call can involve any number of keys. 
- Watch calls simply monitor for changes starting from the point where WATCH was called until EXEC is called. 
- Once EXEC is invoked, all the keys will be UNWATCHed, whether or not the transaction in question was aborted.
- Closing a client connection also triggers all keys to be UNWATCHed.

### Using REDIS Watch Command for Optimistic Locking
👉 The Redis WATCH command provides check-and-set (CAS) functionality to Redis transactions. 
>Keys that are WATCHed are continuously monitored for changes; if even one WATCHed key is changed before the EXEC command is called, the entire transaction will be canceled and EXEC will return NULL to indicate that the transaction was unsuccessful.

Let’s consider an example where we need to increase a key’s value by 1. We can use the following command:

```redis
num = GET sampleKey
num = num + 1
SET sampleKey $num
```

>The commands shown above will work without any issues as long as there is only a single user performing the operation at a particular time. Things become challenging if multiple users attempt to increase the key’s value at the same time, resulting in a race condition. Imagine that the value of original value of sampleKey is 13, and two clients attempt to increment the value at the same time. Both will increase the value to 14 and SET that quantity as the key’s value. This will result in the final value being 14 instead of 15.

**We can eliminate this potential problem by using the WATCH command:**

```redis
WATCH sampleKey
num = GET sampleKey
num = num + 1
MULTI
SET sampleKey $num
EXEC
```

👉With this code, if a race condition occurs and a client modifies the value of num at some point between our invoking WATCH and our invoking EXEC, the transaction will abort. We would need to repeat the transaction when the race condition is no longer present.

👉This locking process is also known as “optimistic locking”, and it provides an effective way to safeguard against race conditions. Most of the time, there are multiple clients accessing various keys, so the chances of these “collisions” are quite small, and it’s not likely that a transaction will need to be repeated.

## Why Redis does not support roll backs?
If you have a relational databases background, the fact that Redis commands can fail during a transaction, but still Redis will execute the rest of the transaction instead of rolling back, may look odd to you.

However there are good opinions for this behavior:

Redis commands can fail only if called with a wrong syntax (and the problem is not detectable during the command queueing), or against keys holding the wrong data type: this means that in practical terms a failing command is the result of a programming errors, and a kind of error that is very likely to be detected during development, and not in production.
Redis is internally simplified and faster because it does not need the ability to roll back.
