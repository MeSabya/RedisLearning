# What is Redis?
Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, in-memory cache and message broker. 
It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams.

üòï ***So many Concepts in One line***

*So Redis can be used as a traditional monolithic and can be used as distributed system as a cluster of nodes with sharding.*

# What is memory caching and what is the value-added by caching?

A Cache is like short-term memory. It is typically faster than the original data source. Accessing data from memory is faster than from a hard disk. Caching means saving frequently accessed data in-memory(short-term memory) so the value that is added by caching is retrieving data fastly and reduce calling the original data source it might be SQL DB because the complexity time of reading data will be o(1) as a direct access operation by key in memory like hashtables.
So Redis is a system that offers to us a caching system in both environments monolithic and distributed.

## How Redis works?

- All Redis data resides in the server‚Äôs main memory, in contrast to databases such as PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and others that store most data on disk.

‚ùì **So as Redis is faster than traditional DB can we consider it the first source of truth?**

## Persistence options:

Redis provides a different range of persistence options:

- **RDB (Redis Database)**: The RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.
- **AOF (Append Only File)**: The AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server, that will be played again at server startup, reconstructing the original dataset. Commands are logged using the same format as the Redis protocol itself, in an append-only fashion. Redis is able to rewrite the log in the background when it gets too big.
- **No Persistence**:  you can disable persistence completely
- **RDB + AOF**: It is possible to combine both AOF and RDB in the same instance. Notice that, in this case, when Redis restarts the AOF file will be used to reconstruct the original dataset since it is guaranteed to be the most complete.

### RDB advantages :
1. RDB is a very compact single-file point-in-time representation of your Redis data. RDB files are perfect for backups. For instance, you may want to archive your RDB files every hour for the latest 24 hours and to save an RDB snapshot every day for 30 days. This allows you to easily restore different versions of the data set in case of disasters.
2. RDB is very good for disaster recovery, being a single compact file that can be transferred to far data centers.
3. RDB allows faster restarts with big datasets compared to AOF

### RDB disadvantages:
1. RDB is NOT good if you need to minimize the chance of data loss in case Redis stops working (for example after a power outage). You can configure different save points where an RDB is produced (for instance after at least five minutes and 100 writes against the data set, but you can have multiple save points). However you‚Äôll usually create an RDB snapshot every five minutes or more, so in case of Redis stopping working without a correct shutdown for any reason, you should be prepared to lose the latest minutes of data.

### AOF advantages:
1. Using AOF Redis is much more durable: you can have different fsync policies: no fsync at all, fsync every second, fsync at every query. With the default policy of fsync every second write performances are still great (fsync is performed using a background thread and the main thread will try hard to perform writes when no fsync is in progress.) but you can only lose one second worth of writes.
2. The AOF log is an append-only log, so there are no seeks, nor corruption problems if there is a power outage. Even if the log ends with a half-written command for some reason (disk full or other reasons) the Redis-check-of tool is able to fix it easily.
3. Redis is able to automatically rewrite the AOF in the background when it gets too big.
4. AOF contains a log of all the operations one after the other in an easy-to-understand and parsed format. You can even easily export an AOF file. For instance, even if you‚Äôve accidentally flushed everything using the FLUSHALL command, as long as no rewrite of the log was performed in the meantime, you can still save your data set just by stopping the server, removing the latest command, and restarting Redis again

### AOF disadvantages:
1. AOF files are usually bigger than the equivalent RDB files for the same dataset.
2. AOF can be slower than RDB depending on the exact fsync policy.
3. Finally, AOF can improve the data consistency but does not guarantee so likely you can lose your data but less than RDB mode considering the RDB is faster.

## Snapshotting:
The default data persistence strategy in Redis is RDB snapshot.
üëâ By default Redis saves snapshots of the dataset on disk, in a binary file called dump.rdb. You can configure Redis to have it save the dataset every N seconds if there are at least M changes in the dataset, or you can manually call the SAVE or BGSAVE commands.

##### How it works:
- Redis forks. We now have a child and a parent process.
- The child starts to write the dataset to a temporary RDB file on disk.
- When the child is done writing the new RDB file, it replaces the old one.
- We can manually change the interval that the snapshot is taken. Those arrangements are in the configuration file called **redis.conf**.

So Redis stores snapshots of your data to disk in a dump.rdb file in the following conditions:
        1. Every minute if 1000 keys were changed.
        2. Every 5 minutes if 10 keys were changed.
        3. Every 15 minutes if 1 key was changed

So if you‚Äôre doing heavy work and changing lots of keys, then a snapshot per minute will be generated for you, in case your changes are not that much then a snapshot every 5 minutes, if it‚Äôs really not that much then every 15 minutes a snapshot will be taken.

## Append-only file:
-  The append-only file is an alternative, fully-durable strategy for Redis
-  You can turn on the AOF in your configuration file **redis.conf**:

```yaml
appendonly yes
```
### How durable is the append-only file?

following options for durability levels:

1.  **appendfsync always**: fsync every time new commands are appended to the AOF. Very very slow, very safe.
2.  **appendfsync everysec**: fsync every second. Fast enough. you can lose 1 second of data if there is a disaster. This is the default mode.
3.  **appendfsync no**: Never fsync, just put your data in the hands of the Operating System. The faster and less safe method. Normally Linux will flush data every 30 seconds with this configuration, but it's up to the kernel exact tuning.


### How it works:
- Redis forks, so now we have a child and a parent process.
- The child starts writing the new AOF in a temporary file in a disk.
- The parent accumulates all the new changes in an in-memory buffer (but at the same time it writes the new changes in the old append-only file, so if the rewriting fails, we are safe).
- When the child is done rewriting the file, the parent gets a signal and appends the in-memory buffer at the end of the file generated by the child.
- Profit! Now Redis atomically renames the old file into the new one and starts appending new data into the new file.

üëâ ***Important Point to take away*** : 
```
So from this, we can understand that Redis can not guarantee consistency under any model as the writing to disk is always done async by the engine.
```
## What about availability?

- It is clear enough that Redis in monolithic can not grantee any level of availability as the single instance means a single point of failure so let‚Äôs explain others models of Redis.
- *Redis Cluster provides a way to run a Redis installation where data is automatically sharded across multiple Redis nodes.*
